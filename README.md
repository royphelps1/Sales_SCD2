# SCD Type 2 Data Warehouse & Semantic Model â€“ Power BI Project

## ðŸ‘‹ Overview
This Power BI project demonstrates how to build a dimensional data model using flat files, apply Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 logic, and create a business-ready semantic layer with DAX measures, relationships, and clean visualizations.

It simulates a typical star schema used in business reporting environments.

- `DimEmployee.csv` â€“ Employee dimension
- `DateTable` â€“ Created in Power BI using DAX
